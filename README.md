# Untitled: Advanced go code snipplets
Code snippets from: https://go101.org/ (Slightly modified)

Usage:
```console
$ git log untitled.go

(check which snipplet you want by commit comment)

$ git checkout <COMMIT_SHA_ID>

(after reading the code comments, for understanding....)

$ go run untitled.go
```
Think of this as a teaching/coaching aid. 

https://go101.org/ is an awesome resource learning go.

Have fun! (0_o)
